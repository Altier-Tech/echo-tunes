Voice-Controlled Music Player with Local Audio Search.

# Description

The "Voice-Controlled Music Player with Local Audio Search" project aims to 
develop a versatile and user-friendly music player application that allows 
users to control music playback using voice commands, including opening 
the player, playing, stopping, skipping, and going back to the previous song. Additionally, the project will implement a voice-based audio search feature to enable users to locate and play specific audio tracks from their local disk effortlessly.
