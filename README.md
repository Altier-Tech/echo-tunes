Voice-Controlled Music Player with Local Audio Search.

# Description

The "Voice-Controlled Music Player with Local Audio Search" project aims to 
develop a versatile and user-friendly music player application that allows 
users to control music playback using voice commands, including opening 
the player, playing, stopping, skipping, and going back to the previous song. 
Additionally, the project will implement a voice-based audio search feature to 
enable users to locate and play specific audio tracks from their local disk 
effortlessly.

# Problem Statement 

Traditional music player applications require manual interaction, which can 
be cumbersome and inconvenient, particularly in situations where hands-free 
operation is desired. Additionally, searching for specific audio tracks within 
a large local library can be time-consuming and challenging. This project 
addresses these issues by providing a hands-free solution for music playback 
control and efficient audio searching, ultimately enhancing user satisfaction.

# Tools & Techniques 

- Python for programming voice recognition and control logic.
- Speech recognition libraries such as CMU Sphinx for voice recognition.
 Integration with a music player application.
 Development of a custom audio search algorithm.
 User interface design using a Tkinter
